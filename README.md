## Technologies:

I've deployed the app in digital ocean using **nginx**.

I don't have a domain url and I'm sorry for that.

## Demo URL

You can try this app in the following link until my digitalocean account expires:  [Try the PokeApp!!!](http://159.89.176.251/)

## How to use the app:

To start the app you'll need install the npm dependencies into the folder client and the folder api.

Then you'll need to create a database in postgresql named pokemon and import a .env file with the next values:

```
DB_NAME=pokemon

DB_USER=yourpostgresuser

DB_PASSWORD=yourpostgrespassword

DB_HOST=localhost
```

Then execute the command:

```
npm start
```

in both files.

### Thanks!!!
